                                    <h2>About Midrub</h2>
                                    <p>Midrub is a platform based on CodeIgniter which allows you to have a Social Marketing Tool. At this moments Midrub supports up to 20 social networks and you can use it to schedule posts, read insights and moderate your comments. It supports RSS Feeds and has a planner where you can schedule easy your posts. </p>
                                    <p>Midrub is not a toy and it is one of the few scripts which allows you to start a stable business. </p>
                                    <p>Why Midrub could be the right solution to start an online business:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Midrub uses official api and you can sign in a contract with social networks. Official api means stable business because there aren't bugs in the api.</li>
                                        <li>Any reported bug will be fixed in the same day or if is minor will be fixed in the next update(max a month).</li>
                                        <li>Midrub already has the same planner which you're seeing in Hootsuite, and in november will be added a button in the quick schedule popup which will allow to select the days of the week and hour when to publish a post.</li>
                                        <li>The new Midrub's demo will be used for a real business and it will work 100%. Each minor bug will be fixed imediatelly.</li>
                                        <li>Midrub is not another script which will be closed for a stupid reason. You can be sure it will be improved for years.</li>
                                        <li>For 2 years Midrub had a non intuitive UI and non intuitive features because i haven't enough inspiration. But now i have advices from more people which know the business and Midrub will become more professional at each update.</li>
                                        <li>The Midrub Stream and Midrub's ADS Manager will make Midrub more useful than other similar tools.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>The documentation here is uncompleted until the next update. If you have a question, you can look in the Midrub's blog <a href="http://blog.midrub.com/" target="_blank">http://blog.midrub.com/</a> where you will find more information.</p>

                                    <p>From the begin Midrub had an original update system. But the update system is not perfect, because a large number of files can't be updated. The max update limit is about 100 files. A lot of servers are slow and have configuration limits and updates with a large number of files will be interrupted before the end.</p>

                                    <h2>How to translate Midrub</h2>
                                    <p>Midrub can be translated in any language you want, but is not simply for more reasons: a lot of files to translate, at each update are added new words and requires a lot of attention.</p>
                                    <p>You have first to create a new language folder here application/language. After you have to copy each files from the folder english and translate them. Each app has its language folders and you have to translate them in the same way.</p>
                                    <p>After that, open the file application/config/config.php and at the variable $config[‘language’] replace the 'english' with the word name of your translation folder.</p>
                                    <p>You have to copy this file <a href="https://github.com/benedmunds/CodeIgniter-Standard-Project/blob/master/system/language/english/form_validation_lang.php">https://github.com/benedmunds/CodeIgniter-Standard-Project/blob/master/system/language/english/form_validation_lang.php</a> in your translation folder and translate too.</p>
                                    <p>And this file&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/avenirer/CodeIgniter-single-language-site/blob/master/application/language/romanian/email_lang.php">https://github.com/avenirer/CodeIgniter-single-language-site/blob/master/application/language/romanian/email_lang.php</a> in your translation folder if you can't send more emails.</p>
                                    <p>In this way you can easily translate Midrub in any language you want.</p>
                                    <p>Please remember, each update means new words to translate, just copy them from the original english files in your edited files.</p>
                                    <p>To understand better how Midrub can be translated, please watch the video below:</p>

                                    <p>The plans page was changed a lot from the version 0.0.7.4. Now it is dynamic and you have to enable plans limits for each enabled app. If the apps aren't enabled, you will not see them in the plans page.</p>
                                    <p>Please read the description at each plan limit. It's important the price to have decimals. It's important for currency code to be correct. It's important to add a correct storage user for each plan. </p>

                                    <h4>Version 0.0.7.4</h4>
                                    <p>This update required a lot of time due to really important changes which required a long test period. </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Plans Page</strong> - the page was rewritten from scratch and added support for apps. Now apps will import them plan's limits once will be enabled.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Cron Job</strong> - i'm going to replace all cron commands url with one single url which will be cron-job. For more details please look in the section Introduction -> Cron Jobs.</li>
                                        <li><strong>User Deletion</strong> - since the apps are standalone and each app has its table in the database, each app should delete the user data when the user will be deleted. For this reason was added this feature in the apps.</li>
                                        <li><strong>My Team widget</strong> - the widget My Team from dashboard was disabled for team's member, was blocked the page Plans for team's member and upgrade's links were removed too.</li>
                                        <li><strong>RSS Section</strong> - was moved in the Posts app. Since more apps will have a RSS section, i've moved RSS section in the Posts's app and was improved. The Faq can be enabled or disabled from Admin Panel -> Apps.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Imgur</strong> - Imgur can display your photos in a hour to more than 100 people i've added the possibility to publish photos in the gallery and will be indexed by Google. Please remember Imgur could easy ban you for abuse(ban means your photos will be hidden for a period).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Inbox's app</strong> - is an universal application which allows to add all your inboxes(emails, twitter, google, etc) and automatize them. By default you have Facebook Pages where you can reply to messages manually, see them, see the author, create quick replies and private messages for each page. The Inbox app has a plan limit for bot's messages. Later will be added other limits for plans. I'm sorry but is not possible to use the alternative Facebook classes for this app. I've tried but is not possible.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Networks</strong> - networks doesn't mean more social networks. I've added a type field for each Networks. The accounts manager in Midrub will be the same but networks will be displayed based on types. For example in the Inbox's app is displayed only Facebook Pages now. In the Ads Manager will be displayed only networks which supports ads. On new Emails app will be displayed the networks which supports smtp. On the Posts app you can see only Networks which has post, rss or insights type. </li>
                                        <li><strong>URL Shortener</strong> - in the Posts's app was added support for url Shortener. By default will be used Midrub Shortener and you have the option in admin to enable Google Shortener. In near future will be added more options. </li>
                                        <li><strong>Posting Error</strong> - in the History tab you will see posting errors for each social account. Users will see posting errors for both manual and RSS's posts. </li>
                                        <li><strong>Bots name and description</strong> - was added now the possibity to add original name for each bot(only admin will see real name). Same for description. You have to edit the Bots classes which are standalone.</li>
                                        
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>The Faq section provides support for any number of languages you have. For each language folder, you will see new inputs and the articles for user will be in the selected&nbsp;language. Same for categories.</p>

                                    <p>The Tickets system in Midrub was rewritten from scratch and now users can create new tickets from the Faq section. As admin you can restrict the creation of new tickets per time or disable it. Was removed the attachements support. Now is supported only subject and ticket’s message. But i think in the future will be added other fields.</p>
                                    <p>As admin you can reply to tickets. When someone creates a ticket, the ticket count will be displayed in the admin panel until admin will reply. Same for user, user will see notification for not replied tickets. User can close it or reply.</p>

                                    <p>The option Google allows you to publish photos and text on Google Plus. This option is based on the Buffer's api. You have to create one Buffer application, which will support unlimitted Buffer accounts. Don's worry about scheduling restrictions, because the posts are scheduled in Midrub not on Buffer.</p>
                                    <p>From the update 0.0.5.5 Midrub allows to use Buffer to publish on Google Plus and people will no see in Midrub the word Buffer. In several steps bellow will be explained how works Google Plus via Buffer:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Go to <a href="https://buffer.com/developers/apps/create">https://buffer.com/developers/apps/create</a></li>

                                        <li>Create a new application</li>

                                        <li>Add your Your Callback URL: http://yourwebsite.com/admin/callback/google</li>

                                        <li>You will receive Client ID and Secret by email</li>

                                        <li>Then go to Midrub -&gt; Admin Panel -&gt; Networks -&gt; Google</li>

                                        <li>Enter the Client ID and Secret</li>

                                        <li>Enable, after enable if you refresh, you will get an error, don't worry, because the Google's class is standalone and has it's optional table in the database. Refresh again.</li>

                                        <li>Now, users can submit their Google Plus accounts(email and password). Passwords will be encoded in the database.</li>

                                        <li>You can approve or delete submissions. All submissions will be displayed in Midrub -&gt; Admin Panel -&gt; Networks -&gt; Google</li>

                                        <li>To approve an account, you have to login in the Google Plus account and connect it in your Buffer account, then with a click you will be able to approve it for user in Midrub(Better is to become the Google Partner, but if you can't you can use Buffer to publish).</li>

                                        <li>You can connect via api even more Buffer accounts.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                        I don't know if you will prefer this app for Facebook Pages Inbox instead the new Midrub's Stream, but at least you can create quick replies for each page and the bot will reply to questions in the Facebook Page's chat. Another feature is private messages. You can create a list with private messages which will be sent to people which comment your Facebook Page's posts.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        At this moment the Inbox app supports exact phrases and keywords. Exact phrases means if someone ask exact what you've written in a bot's message, the bot will reply. I think you will prefer the keywords where each keyword should be in a message. Reply is only plan text.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I will explain how i will add Twitter, but in the same way you can add any network you want. Please follow exactly my instructions.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        First in assets/apps/inbox/networks i will create a new folder <strong>twitter</strong>. Inside i will create two folders: <strong>js</strong> and <strong>styles</strong>. In the folder <strong>js</strong> i will create the file <strong>main.js</strong> where i will add all js code for Twitter. My ajax calls will have the url <strong>url + 'user/app-ajax/inbox'</strong> and parameters <strong>action</strong>(name of the php's method) and <strong>network</strong> will be twitter to say where is located the wanted php method.
                                        In the folder <strong>styles</strong> i will create the folder <strong>styles</strong> and inside the file <strong>styles.css</strong> with network's styles. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Then inside the folder application/apps/collection/inbox/networks i will create another folder called <strong>twitter</strong>. After, in the folder <strong>twitter</strong> i will create files:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>main.php</strong> - is the first called class when a network is loaded. You have to follow the interface MidrubApps\Collection\Inbox\Interfaces\Networks The method network_info should return an array with keys(please look in my Facebook Pages example). 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>ajax.php</strong> - is the file called by ajax. You have to add there all your methods.  
                                        </li>       
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>bot.php</strong> - is the file called by social networks. There you have to write all bot's commands.  
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>footer.php</strong> - is the file which will contain all your modals. You can see two modals in the Facebook Pages like example.  
                                        </li>

                                    <p>
                                        The bot's url will be https://www.midrub.com/social/user/bots/inbox?action=load_bots&bot=twitter

                                    <h4>CSRF Filtering</h4>

                                    <p>We have enabled CSRF protection by added $config['csrf_protection'] = TRUE; in the application/config/config.php file. Also, we have used the form helper for each forms.</p>

                                    <h4>Session hijacking</h4>

                                    <p>We added $config['sess_use_database'] = TRUE; in the application/config/config.php file and all sessions are saved in the database.</p>

                                    <h4>Why there is NO captcha for login and sign up forms? </h4>

                                    <p>Because after 5 failed attempts to login, the user is blocked for one hour. Once registered/signed up, the ip address is stored and the user will not be able to register/sign up again for 24 hours. Also you can choose, that it will not be possible to register/sign up ever, from the same ip address. This way, we simplified the login and sign up steps, without being necessary to complete other fields. </p>

                                    <p>All uploaded images and videos in the user panel will have only the read permissions. Midrub allows to run only it's files which are included in the htaccess. The htaccess from the folder assets will prevent the execution of php files in all subfolders.  </p>
                                    
                                    <p>For vulnerable folders i've disabled via Htaccess the php files execution but this solution won't work o Nginx.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Please, remember, i'm only a web developer and any big/middle companies have security engineers which only ensure the security for the company's projects. If you have ideas how to improve the security for Midrub, please let me know, i will check to add them.</p>
